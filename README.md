# mulch

A plugin that sculpts and shapes SVs with tweeners for the video game [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver).

Originally named `mul` as a shortening of "multiply". However with the inclusion of the ability to add, its name became misleading.

### Features

- Support for [all common eases](https://easings.net/).
- The ability to apply the ease over the entire section, or treating each note as its own section.
- Keyboard shortcuts (`UIOP`), including swapping `from` and `to`, as well as performing the 3 types of actions.
- Functionality to add in-between SVs — also known as smearing — to existing SVs.
- A toggle to specify adding or multiplying to the existing SV.
